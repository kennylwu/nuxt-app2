> My groovy Nuxt.js project
>
> > During our phone call we also discussed the idea of having you produce a small code sample which we might review during the visit. (i.e., build a mock portfolio site in vue.js / nuxt that has a homepage, portfolio page, and a contact form.) We could also sit down and go over our project base, workflow plan, etc., in a bit more detail.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
